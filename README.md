# Shopping-Cart
it's a simple shopping cart ,i used PHP JS CSS HTML5 JQUERY AJAX technology and some bootstrap even when i didn't want to use any of it

- i can add/remove products to my virtual cart in any quantities
- i can see my current cart status
- i have to choose transport type from some select, 'pick up'  'UPS' , by default it's not chosen, and if i don't
choose it, it says i have to when i click 'pay'
- i can click 'pay', which will deduct costs from my current cash (my cash is 100$) , and will write the price and the rest
received.
- near each product there is rating from 1 to 5, i can rate it and i see current average rating of each product. Rates are saved
between each visits and they stay saved. Please store them in Mysql DB.
